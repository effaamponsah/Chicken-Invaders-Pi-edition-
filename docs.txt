Pygame is built on another game creation library called Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)
SDL was written in C, a language commonly used for games because of its speed and ability to work with the hardware at a low level.
But developing in C, or its successor C++, can be slow and error prone.


#Almost all everything needed is in the modules

.locals ::: Used to store the games constants









#functions used
.init()  :: initialized the game engine
.BLIT:::copied one screen to another
