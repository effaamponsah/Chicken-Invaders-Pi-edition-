# Chicken Invaders Pi-edition
This is a simple game made with the pygame library. If you loved the PC version of chicken invaders, we bet you will love this one as we try
to bring you a striped down version of it on your raspberry pi. This project is being developed as part of the Computer Science and Information Technology week celebration exhibition day.
